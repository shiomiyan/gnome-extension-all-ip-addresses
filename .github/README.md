# gnome-extension-all-ip-addresses

This is the code behind the GNOME Shell Extension called **ALL IP Addresses**, available in the GNOME Shell Extension store at https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3994/all-ip-addresses/

## Introduction

This extention is based upon the lan-ip-address extention. I added the switch between LAN, WAN and IPv6 and VPN.
This extention will only show the IP-addresses your workstation will use to communicate to the internet (IPv4 and IPv6) or your LAN. Virtual host-only interfaces (like e.g. Docker or VirtualBox interfaces) will not show.

## How it works
To get the different IP addresses, internally this extension runs a shell command to find ikterface the workstation will use to reacht an adrress in the internet.

## Known limitations
In the atypical case that you are working on a LAN not connected to the Internet (such as an isolated lab), you have no route that could reach public ip-addresses, so things will not work the way this extension is currently designed.

## Credits
This code is based upon a fork of https://github.com/Josholith/gnome-extension-lan-ip-address
